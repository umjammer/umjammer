<h1>Lode Runner (TM)</h1>

This applet may be copyrighted by Broderbund, SYSTEM SOFT, and Doug Smith.
I created it by porting C source code that was manually decompiled from the original executable binary, which was built using Lattice C.

It has been quite some time since web browsers stopped supporting applets, and they seemed to have disappeared entirely.
But now, applets are making a comeback! With this <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cheerpj-applet-runner/bbmolahhldcbngedljfadjlognfaaein">Chrome extension</a>,
you can see the applet running below.
