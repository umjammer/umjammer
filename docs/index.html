I made this applet by porting C source code which made from
hand discompiling original executable binary made by Lattice C.

It's been a long time since web browsers stop playing applets. It seemed disappeared.
But now, Applet is back! Using this <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cheerpj-applet-runner/bbmolahhldcbngedljfadjlognfaaein">Chrome extension</a> you can see the applet running below.
